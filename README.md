# Encrypted Image Video Steganography using MATLAB

## Overview
This project explores the implementation of encrypted image video steganography using MATLAB. The goal is to conceal secret information within digital video content while maintaining high imperceptibility, robustness, and embedding capacity.

## Project Components
- **Algorithm:** Utilizes a sophisticated scrambling algorithm to obfuscate video frames spatially and temporally.
- **Encoding:** Secret messages (binary image logos) are encoded using Hamming code (7, 4) for enhanced security.
- **Embedding:** Embeds the encoded message into randomly selected areas of video frames using XOR function.
- **Decoding:** Retrieves and decodes embedded data from video frames using inverse transformations and decryption algorithms.
- **Evaluation:** Performance metrics include Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) to assess embedding efficiency and video quality.
